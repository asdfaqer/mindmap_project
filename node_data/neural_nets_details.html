<p>Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are a core component of deep learning and are used to recognize patterns and make predictions from data. Composed of interconnected "neurons" organized in layers, these networks learn by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons based on input data. They are particularly effective in tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing, where traditional algorithms struggle with complex, high-dimensional data.</p>
