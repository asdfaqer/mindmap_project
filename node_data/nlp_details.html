<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages, and deals with how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Key NLP tasks include text translation, spam detection, sentiment analysis, information extraction, and conversational AI (chatbots). NLP techniques leverage linguistic rules, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models to achieve its objectives.</p>
